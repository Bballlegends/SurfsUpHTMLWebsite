		<h2>A Surfing Themed Card Game Made For All 	Ages</h2>
		<h4>Made By The Mclean Family</h4>
		<p> Made by a Family trying to make a fun 	card game as a hobby! Our family loves 	games and can't wait to share a new amazing 	one with you! We are based in Melbourne, 	Australia, and have made this entire game 	from scratch, at home. This card game was 	made with love and effort by our family and 	we <em>cannot</em> thank you enough for 	buying it. Have fun banking Point Breaks 	and waiting for the tsunami to come.</p>
